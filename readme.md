# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game coded in JavaScript. The game allows players to guess letters in a hidden word and tries to guess the word before running out of attempts.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will randomly select a word from a pre-defined list of words and display it as blank spaces.
3. Guess letters by clicking on the on-screen keyboard or by typing on your physical keyboard.
4. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the blank spaces. If not, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.
6. If you correctly guess the word, you win the game! If you run out of attempts, you lose.
